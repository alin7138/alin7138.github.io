Currently, collecting and tracking COVID-19 data is undoubtedly a global priority. With this abundance of open data on cases, I decided to try my hand at visualizing cases in Canada over time. The resulting graph is an animated bar chart showing confirmed cases by province. It is arranged by descending number of cases so as to highlight provinces with the most cases.

 Early in the pandemic, British Columbia (BC) has a majority of cases, possibly owing to the high amount of international travel through Vancouver. As we progressed into late March and community spread becomes a larger player in the outbreak, BC is overtaken by more densely populated provinces like Ontario (ON) and Quebec (QC). The sparsely populated territories maintain fewer cases with Nunavut (NU) currently having none (as of 5/18/20).



The following is a tutorial on how to make an animated bar chart using ```tidyverse``` and ```gganimate``` in R. 



### Getting the data
The Government of Canada has an interactive [dashboard](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html) and map of COVID-19 cases across all provinces. It also hosts the data used for these data visualizations which can be downloaded under the time series graph.

### Previewing the data

These are the packages I used and their general function:

* ```tidyverse``` : for data wrangling and plotting
* ```gganimate``` : animating plot
* ```janitor``` : cleaning up column names
* ```lubridate``` : converting to date formats
* ```extrafont``` : to use system fonts in final graphic

The data comes in a ```.csv``` format and looks something like this:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(extrafont)


data <- read.csv("covid19.csv")

str(data)
```

```{r warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(formatR)
table <- data %>% 
  kable("html") %>%
  #column_spec(column = 9, width_min = "4in", include_thead = T) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),full_width = F) %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "500px")

table
```

### Cleaning up the data

Although there are multiple attributes available, I am interested in plotting the number of confirmed cases (numconf). Several issues can be identified by previewing the data:

* **Province abbreviations are missing**: this isn't a huge problem but for readability, having a shorter label in the final plot is preferred. I address this by using an ```inner_join``` to combine a two column table with the province ID (pruid) and province abbreviation (prabb). I copied and created a delimited text file from this [table](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-195-x/2011001/geo/prov/tbl/tbl8-eng.htm). This also removes entries for Canada and repatriated travellers.
* **Date column**: This is currently a factor and is not the right data type. I used a combination of ```as.character()``` and ```dmy()``` from the lubridate package to convert it to a date.
* **Missing data:** For some provinces, there isn't a row for dates before their first case which is a little awkward for plotting. I used the ```complete()``` function to create rows for each province that was missing dates and populated those numconf values with ```fill()```. 

Since the final graph is organized based on ranking in term of cases, I used ```mutate``` to add a ranking column for each date.

```{r eval = FALSE}
pruid <- read.csv('pruid.csv', sep = '\t') %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(c(3,4))

colnames(pruid) <- c('prabb','pruid')
pruid <- pruid %>% mutate(pruid = replace(pruid, prabb == "NU", 62))

data_formatted <- data

data_formatted$date <- as.character(data_formatted$date)
data_formatted$date <- dmy(data_formatted$date)

data_plot <- data_formatted %>% 
  complete(date = seq.Date(min(date), max(date), by="day"),pruid) %>%
  mutate(numconf=ifelse(date==min(date) & is.na(numconf), 0, numconf)) %>% 
  group_by(pruid) %>% 
  fill(numconf) %>% 
  select(date:numconf) %>% 
  inner_join(pruid) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(-numconf, ties.method = "first"))
```

### Plotting and animating the data

This code section closely follows [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53162821/animated-sorted-bar-chart-with-bars-overtaking-each-other) Stack Overflow thread. The first section involves creating static plots for each date using ```ggplot2```. The last section involves animating this plot by using the date attribute as the time step. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
staticplot <- data_plot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rank, group = prabb, fill=prabb, color=prabb))+
  geom_tile(aes(y=numconf/2, height = numconf, width = 0.9))+
  coord_flip(clip="off", expand = FALSE)+
  scale_x_reverse()+
  geom_text(aes(y=0, label=paste(prabb, " ")),vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1.2)+
  geom_text(aes(y=numconf, label = paste0(" ",round(numconf)), hjust=-0.2, size=16))+
  xlab("")+
  ylab("")+
  labs(title=paste('Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by Province on ', '{closest_state}'),
       subtitle='SOURCE: Government of Canada') +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    panel.background=element_blank(),
    axis.ticks=element_blank(),
    legend.position = 'none',
    plot.margin = margin(1,2,1,2, "cm"),
    text=element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro", color = "grey20", size=16),
    plot.subtitle=element_text(face="italic",size=12,colour="grey40"),
    plot.title=element_text(size=18,face="bold")
  )

anim <- staticplot + transition_states(date, transition_length = 4, state_length = 2)

animate(anim, 100, fps = 25, duration = 20, width = 750, height = 750, 
        renderer = gifski_renderer("051720_covid_numconf.gif"))
```
