      <description>DEVELOP is a capacity building initiative under NASA&amp;rsquo;s Applied Sciences Program. As a participant, I undertook research projects that focus on the utility of earth observations in alleviating environmental issues.
Projects Assessing Coastal Water Quality in Belize&amp;rsquo;s Coral Reefs
This project focused on creating a Google Earth Engine dashboard to extract chlorophyll and turbidity metrics from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical datasets.
Alaska Ecological Forecasting
Wetlands are ecosystems that experience seasonal or permanent inundation.</description>

Graphical abstract Abstract Mangrove forests are a highly productive ecosystem that provide numerous ecosystem services to coastal communities. Mangroves can trap sediments and filter out harmful substances from runoff. This water filtration will be crucial in mitigating the projected decline in water quality driven by increased human development and extreme precipitation due to climate change.</description>
