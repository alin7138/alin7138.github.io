      <description>Currently, collecting and tracking COVID-19 data is undoubtedly a global priority. With this abundance of open data on cases, I decided to try my hand at visualizing cases in Canada over time. The resulting graph is an animated bar chart showing confirmed cases by province. It is arranged by descending number of cases so as to highlight provinces with the most cases.

Early in the pandemic, British Columbia (BC) has a majority of cases, possibly owing to the high amount of international travel through Vancouver.</description>
