Graphical abstract Abstract Mangrove forests are a highly productive ecosystem that provide numerous ecosystem services to coastal communities. Mangroves can trap sediments and filter out harmful substances from runoff. This water filtration will be crucial in mitigating the projected decline in water quality driven by increased human development and extreme precipitation due to climate change.</description>

      <description>I conducted a land use change analysis for the area surrounding Edmonton, AB between 1966 and 1976 for my advanced GIS course. This involved using classified imagery and generating landscape metrics in Fragstats. Exerpts and figures from the report are below.
Executive Summary: Urbanization and population growth have left impacts on the landscape surrounding Edmonton, AB. The urban built-up areas around the city increased from 19,596 ha to 54,995 ha between 1966 and 1976, translating to a doubling of the proportion of the land it previously occupied.</description>
