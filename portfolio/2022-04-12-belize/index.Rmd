The Belize Barrier Reef is one of the largest coral reef systems in the world, providing services such as tourism and fisheries which total to about 12-15% of the nation's GDP. With increasing anthropogenic impacts that influence coastal water quality, we worked with partners to create a tool that outputs a time series of sea surface temperatures, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a concentrations. These parameters are derived from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS satellite imagery. This tool can be used to identify reef areas experiencing depreciating water quality, inform areas in need of protection, and examine coastal changes after large disturbances.
