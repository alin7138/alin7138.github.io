**Skills and tools:** *Mapbox, HTML, CSS, Javascript, ArcGIS*

* adpated webmaps for print report

Earth Economics was contracted by the [Pacific Salmon Commission](https://www.psc.org/) to conduct a study on the food, social, and ceremonial importance of salmon to Tribes and First Nations in the Pacific Salmon Treaty regions. The objectives and findings of the study as well as webmaps can be found [here](https://www.eartheconomics.org/psc)
