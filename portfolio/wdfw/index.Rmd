![Report infographic showing origins of WA state land visitors](/img/wdfw_infographic.PNG)

**Skills and tools:** *ArcGIS, QGIS, Google BigQuery, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, network analysis*

##### Contributions
* Processed > 90 billion mobile device location data points between 2019 and early 2021
* Derived attributes for each recreation land unit to be used in visitation model (eg. population w/in 5 mi, climate, air quality, campgrounds present)
* Generated 50 mi road networks for each recreation land unit to refine economic contribution analysis
* Designed final report

You can find the final report [here.](https://www.eartheconomics.org/all-publications/2022/wdfw)
