Earth Economics conducted a study on the impacts of the outdoor recreation economy in Oregon. I supported this project by creating a database of recreation lands, analyzing cellphone location data, and cartography for the [final report](https://www.eartheconomics.org/all-publications/2020/outdoor-recreation-oregon) and fact sheets.
